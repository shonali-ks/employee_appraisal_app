# employee_appraisal_app
This application does basic # CRUD operations on the details of employees working in a company. It takes in data like their name, position/designation, salary, age, and gender. We can add, update, and delete any of these fields.
# Technologies used  are 
Angular (version 9) and Angular material.
For backend (server-side) I have used # nodejs and also # express modules , mongoose for MongoDB, etc.
